ASSIGNMENT SET – 2 (INTEGER ARRAYS) - (BatchA)

Write a program to check whether a system is little endian or big endian.

Hint : For little endian lower-order byte of the data is stored in memory at the lowest address and for big endian higher-order byte is stored at lowest address

Write a program to read two 16 bit numbers add them and print also.

Write a program to read two 32 bit numbers add them and print the result.

Write a program to search for a number in an array of numbers using linear search
Write a program to input 10 numbers into an array and find the second smallest among them

Write a program to sort an array of numbers in ascending order ( size = 2 bytes each) using bubble sort / selection sort / insertion sort.
